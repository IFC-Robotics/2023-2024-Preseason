To do ASAP:

- run testAprilTagDetection.java
- run testTransferSystem.java
- run leftSideHighJunction.java, but only the driving movements (comment out the scoring* code, since it isn't finished yet)
- run rightSideHighJunction.java, but only the driving movements (comment out the scoring* code, since it isn't finished yet)
- finish configuring buttons in teleOpWithRobotClass.java
- update robotClass.java for new pulley-system for rotating the claw

- Once you update robotClass.java
    - run leftSideHighJunction.java (including scoring code)
    - run rightSideHighJunction.java (including scoring code)

- Once you update teleOpWithRobotClass.java
    - run teleOpWithRobotClass.java (make sure everything works)

* "scoring code" = code that has to do with collecting, transferring, or depositing

To do eventually:

- In robot class:
    - test turn method
    - configure linear lift method w/ count-to-inch conversion factor
    - learn how to make methods asynchronous
    - test computer vision helper methods
