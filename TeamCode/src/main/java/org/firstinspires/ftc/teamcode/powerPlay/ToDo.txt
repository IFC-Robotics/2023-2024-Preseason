Servos

    - make servo_rotate_hook regular (right now it's continuous)
    - plug in servos
    - run TestServoClass.java

    - fix issue w/ servos
        - one issue happens during initialization, and there may be more issues
        - see servos in FSM.java in assist mode to recreate issues
        - if necessary, add "Warning: Robot Moves On Initialization" sticker

    - test servo_claw
        - make sure servo opens/closes
        - make sure servo actually grabs cone
    - test servo_rotate_claw
        - make sure servo turns to the desired positions
        - make sure servo can lift/lower the claw
            - without a cone
            - with a cone

    - test servo_hook
        - make sure servo extends/retracts
        - make sure servo actually grabs cone
    - test servo_rotate_hook
        - make sure servo turns to the desired positions
        - make sure servo doesn't drop the cone

Distances

    - test all 5 vertical lift distances
    - test both horizontal lift distances
    - make sure both rightHighAuton.java and leftHighAuton.java work consistently

FSM

    - test entire scoring system together in teleOp
        - slowly, see if it works
        - proof that our robot will actually work
    - test FSM

Other

    - confirm that the current controls are good (for Charlie & Nathan)
    - find out why AprilTags sometimes doesn't work
    - add edge case for no apriltag detection
        - if Robot.tag == 0, then go to the closest zone to the middle (i.e. 3 of the left side and 1 for the right side)

Outreach
    - (mandatory) create opponent assessment template. See google doc for details.
    - (mandatory) go through emails, and check all emails about upcoming events (must be cabinet member / high-level member)
    - (optional) add notes & photos from winter break to google drive. Ask Violet (or make her do this task)

Rules

    - signal sleeve counting as cone
