To Do:

- fix issue w/ servos
    - one issue happens during initialization, and there may be more issues
    - see servos in FSM.java in assist mode to recreate issues

- test lift class (1) auton & (2) teleOp assist mode
    - Note: horizontal lift gets stuck coming back, causing it to unspool (and therefore break)
    - I broke the horizontal lift! Must fix before testing.
    - vertical lift isn't plugged in, b/c a metal bar is right next to the motor, so it's impossible to plug in. Must fix before testing.

- fix drivetrain auton
- test initial movement to FSM position

- fix camera auton

--------------------------------------- Fix everything above before continuing below ---------------------------------------

- test finite state machine (switch statement)

- test rightHighAuton.java
    - make a copy for the left side (see comments)

- think about what the controls should be (joysticks, buttons, etc.)

- if necessary, add "Warning: Robot Moves On Initialization" sticker
