Servos

    - (fabrication) switch rotate_claw servo from the current one to the one in the programming bag (w/ straight orange thing)
    - (fabrication) switch claw servo from the current one to the one in the programming bag (w/ circular orange thing)
    - (fabrication) fix horizontal lift (see back right corner)

    - test servo_claw
        - make sure claw actually grabs cone
    - test servo_rotate_claw
        - might be broken, make sure it works
        - make limits correspond with code (isn't working rn)
        - make sure servo can lift/lower the claw
            - without a cone
            - with a cone
    - test servo_rotate_hook
        - make limits correspond with code (isn't working rn)

Distances

    - test the starting and ending positions for servo_claw, servo_rotate_claw, and servo_rotate_hook
    - test all 5 vertical lift distances
    - test both horizontal lift distances
    - make sure both rightHighAuton.java and leftHighAuton.java work consistently

FSM

    - test FSM
        - uncomment horizontal lift code when it gets fixed (fabrication)
        - fix issue w/ servos
        - uncomment servo_rotate_hook code when it gets fixed (run programs above)
    - test entire scoring system together in teleOp
        - proof that our robot will actually work

Other

    - confirm that the current controls are good (for Charlie & Nathan)
    - find out why AprilTags sometimes doesn't work
    - add edge case for no apriltag detection
        - if Robot.tag == 0, then go to the closest zone to the middle (i.e. 3 of the left side and 1 for the right side)
    - if necessary, add "Warning: Robot Moves On Initialization" sticker

Outreach

    - (mandatory) create opponent assessment template. See google doc for details.
    - (mandatory) go through emails, and check all emails about upcoming events (must be cabinet member / high-level member)
    - (optional) add notes & photos from winter break to google drive. Ask Violet (or make her do this task)

Rules

    - signal sleeve counting as cone
