To Do ASAP (in order):

Programming - make servo_rotate_hook regular (right now it's continuous)
            - plug in servos
            - run TestServoClass.java

            - fix issue w/ servos
                - one issue happens during initialization, and there may be more issues
                - see servos in FSM.java in assist mode to recreate issues

Fabricating - fix horizontal lift (front right wheel gets in the way, so it doesn't rlly work rn)
            - attach claw to robot
            - plug in horizontal lift servos w/ extension cables

Programming - test horizontal lift auton
            - test horizontal lift teleOpAssistMode
            - test horizontal lift teleOpManualMode
            - test horizontal lift claw
                - make sure servo opens/closes
                - make sure claw actually grabs cone
            - test horizontal lift rotate_claw
                - make sure servo can lift/lower the claw
                    - without a cone
                    - with a cone

Fabricating - fix vertical lift
            - plug in vertical lift servos w/ extension cables

Programming - uncomment vertical lift code
            - test vertical lift auton
            - test vertical lift teleOpAssistMode
            - test vertical lift teleOpManualMode
            - test vertical lift hook
                - make sure servo extends/retracts
                - make sure servo actually grabs cone
            - test vertical lift rotate_claw
                - make sure servo turns to the desired positions
                - make sure cone doesn't fall out

            - test entire scoring system together in teleOp
                - slowly, see if it works
                - proof that our robot will actually work
            - test rightHighAuton.java
                - make a copy for the left side (reverse the direction of strafing, turning, and Robot.side)
            - test FSM
            - confirm that the current controls are good (for Charlie & Nathan)

            - add edge case for no apriltag detection
                - if Robot.tag == 0, then go to the closest zone to the middle (i.e. 3 of the left side and 1 for the right side)
            - find out why AprilTags sometimes doesn't work

Outreach:
    - (mandatory) create opponent assessment template. See google doc for details.
    - (mandatory) go through emails, and check all emails about upcoming events (must be cabinet member / high-level member)
    - (optional) add notes & photos from winter break to google drive. Ask Violet (or make her do this task)
    - (optional) Put together an instagram/twitter post about meet 1. I'll review it Wednesday morning and we can post it.
    - (optional) Put together an instagram/twitter post about out work over winter break. I'll review it Wednesday morning and we can post it.

- if necessary, add "Warning: Robot Moves On Initialization" sticker
