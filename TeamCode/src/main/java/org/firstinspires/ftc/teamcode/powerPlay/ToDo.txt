To Do Tuesday 1/10 (in order):

Programming - test telemetry
            - test autonomous driving (using telemetry)
                - try testing just one wheel
            - test initial movement to FSM position
            - test camera (using telemetry + signal sleeves)

Fabricating - fix horizontal lift
                - re-spool it
                - make it smoother
            - attach claw to robot
            - plug in horizontal lift servos w/ extension cables
``
Programming - test horizontal lift auton
            - test horizontal lift teleOpAssistMode
            - test horizontal lift teleOpManualMode
            - test horizontal lift claw
                - make sure servo opens/closes
                - make sure claw actually grabs cone
            - test horizontal lift rotate_claw
                - make sure servo can lift/lower the claw
                    - without a cone
                    - with a cone

Fabricating - fix vertical lift (not enough space to plug in)
            - plug in vertical lift servos w/ extension cables

Programming - uncomment vertical lift code
            - test vertical lift auton
            - test vertical lift teleOpAssistMode
            - test vertical lift teleOpManualMode
            - test vertical lift hook
                - make sure servo extends/retracts
                - make sure servo actually grabs cone
            - test vertical lift rotate_claw
                - make sure servo turns to the desired positions
                - make sure cone doesn't fall out

--------------------------------------------------------------------- Other ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Once everything above is done:
    - test everything together in teleOp (claw -> rotate claw -> horizontal lift -> hook -> rotate hook -> vertical lift -> score)
        - slowly, see if it works
        - proof that our robot will actually work
    - test rightHighAuton.java
        - if it works, make a copy for the left side (see comments - just reverse the direction of all of the strafing and turning. Also don't forget to update Robot.side!)
    - test FSM
    - confirm that the current controls are good

Outreach:
    - (mandatory) create opponent assessment template. See google doc for details.
    - (mandatory) go through emails, and check all emails about upcoming events (must be cabinet member / high-level member)
    - (optional) add notes & photos from winter break to google drive. Ask Violet (or make her do this task)
    - (optional) Put together an instagram/twitter post about meet 1. I'll review it Wednesday morning and we can post it.
    - (optional) Put together an instagram/twitter post about out work over winter break. I'll review it Wednesday morning and we can post it.

Other:
    - fix issue w/ servos
        - one issue happens during initialization, and there may be more issues
        - see servos in FSM.java in assist mode to recreate issues

- if necessary, add "Warning: Robot Moves On Initialization" sticker
